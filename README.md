## 🚀 Features
 
 Software  | Link  | Introduction
 ---- | ----- | ------  
 Laboratory electrophysiological system  | [Here](https://github.com/robinxie21/PortbridgeSolutions/tree/main/Instruction/chm/Laboratory%20electrophysiological%20system) |  Cardiac electrophysiological optical mapping software is a specialized system for analyzing cardiac electrical activity. It works by using fluorescent dyes loaded into heart tissue or cells. A high-speed camera then records changes in fluorescence, which reflect variations in membrane voltage or ion concentrations (like calcium), allowing for the simultaneous recording of action potentials and calcium transients  
 EasyAPT Software  | [Here](https://github.com/robinxie21/PortbridgeSolutions/tree/main/Instruction/chm/EasyAPT%20Software) | This software is a no-code platform designed for rapid algorithm validation and iteration. It features an intuitive, drag-and-drop modular interface that allows users to freely combine algorithmic components and manually define data flow directions. By eliminating the need for coding, it significantly streamlines the algorithm assembly process. This enables researchers and engineers to quickly build, adjust, and test the impact of different algorithm combinations and procedures on outcomes, thereby accelerating the pace of algorithm exploration and optimization.
 Laboratory Recording Software  | [Here](https://github.com/robinxie21/PortbridgeSolutions/tree/main/Instruction/chm/NADH%20Ablation%20Area%20Fluorescence%20Analysis%20Software) | Laboratory record software is a professional tool designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data recording during experiments. It standardizes the recording process to effectively prevent the omission of critical information and ensures data format consistency and traceability. Additionally, the software integrates data upload and multiple backup functions, providing robust protection for the security and integrity of research data. 
 NADH Ablation Area Fluorescence Analysis Software  | [Here](https://github.com/robinxie21/PortbridgeSolutions/tree/main/Instruction/chm/NADH%20Ablation%20Area%20Fluorescence%20Analysis%20Software)  |  NADH Ablation Area Fluorescence Analysis Software​ is a specialized tool designed for the quantitative analysis of NADH fluorescence signal changes in myocardial tissue following laser ablation. It enables automatic identification of ablation zone boundaries and precise calculation of key parameters such as fluorescence intensity decay rate and ablation area, providing critical data support for evaluating ablation efficacy and myocardial metabolic status.
